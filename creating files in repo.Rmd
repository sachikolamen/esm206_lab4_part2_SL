##### Create ggplot graph and save somewhere

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = island)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = species))
```
```{r}
#save the plot using `ggsave()` this will default save the most recently created graph unless otherwise specified. Can also use `here()` to save to specific locations. Tell where to save, and what to save as

ggsave(here("figures", "penguins_count.png"))
```
